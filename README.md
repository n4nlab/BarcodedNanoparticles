## Code

This folder contains all the scripts used to analyse and characterize the nanoparticles and also the script used to classify the different barcodes encoded into these nanoparticles.

*Detailed description of the different files.* 

## Datasets

This folder contains the (raw and preprocessed) datasets used to train the ML classification model.

*Detailed description of the different datasets and its naming.*
