# Barcoded Nanoparticles
Hello! Welcome to the Barcoded Nanoparticles repository, here you can find the codes and datasets described in the manuscript ***"Identification of fluorescently-barcoded nanoparticles using machine learning"*** *(attach link when published)*.

## Code

This folder contains all the scripts used to analyse and characterize the nanoparticles and also the script used to classify the different barcodes encoded into these nanoparticles.

*Detailed description of the different files.* 

## Datasets

This folder contains the (raw and preprocessed) datasets used to train the ML classification model.

*Detailed description of the different datasets and its naming.*
